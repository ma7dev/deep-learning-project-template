# Deep Learning Project Template

This template of a deep learning project where we are using the following `PyTorch Lightning`, `Pydantic` and much more!

## Setup

- Build a python environment using `python=3.7.13`. You can refer to [this article](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) for more information.
- Access the environment and install `poetry` using the following command: `pip install poetry`.
- Install dependencies using this command: `poetry install`.
- Create an account on [`wandb`](https://wandb.ai/site) then login to `wandb` in your machine using this command: `wandb login`.
- Start training by running this command: `python scripts/train.py`.
- While training, watch your model training on [`wandb`](https://wandb.ai/site).
